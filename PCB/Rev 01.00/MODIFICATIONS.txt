- PCB too wide
- Add input fuse
- MCU >CODE in wrong layer
- Add silkscreen labels for connectors etc
- Programming works if SPI level shifters are removed
- Should work without level shifting at all. Needs to be tested
- If not add pull up to U5 dir and pull it down with FW once programmed?
- Button 4 not connected
- change MCP23017 reset to one of the SPI pins. PD5 won't work
